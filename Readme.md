# opencv_solution_for_android_game_tiaoyitiao_using_raspberry_pi
# 基于树莓派的微信跳一跳硬件作弊器

## Introduction
tiaoyitiao(jump and jump) is once a quite famous game on wechat game platform. Here I have developed a hardware cheater for this android game using opencv and raspberry pi. Specifically, I use a tiny camera to take pictures of the screen, then those pictures will be analysed using opencv on raspberry pi 3b (traditional methods). In the end a single servo and some hot dog( yes the "hot dog") will be used to simulated human finger to play the game.

## Result
Our harware system can achieve 150 - 300 points on normal smartphone, that's a lot more than what a non-expert can achieve. Improvement can obviously be made but since I just design this system for fun, I don't really want to do this anymore after 5 days of hardwork :). (this is my first project in the area of computer vision)
